### Project Description
The Smart Parking System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of finding and booking parking spaces. It allows users to search for parking locations, view real-time slot availability, and book slots in advance. The system handles user details and generates a digital receipt for every booking, making the parking experience hassle-free and efficient.

### The Problem statement
Finding a parking spot in busy urban areas is a significant challenge for drivers, often leading to wasted time, increased fuel consumption, and traffic congestion. The lack of real-time information about available parking slots adds to the frustration and inefficiency of the daily commute.

### The Solution
Our solution is a digital platform that brings parking management to the user's fingertips. By enabling users to check slot availability and book spots in advance, we reduce the uncertainty and time spent searching for parking. The system provides a seamless interface for checking locations, selecting slots, and confirming bookings with a calculated fee.
